## myindex.html

This page demonstrates the use of semantic HTML5 elements and basic web page structure. Key features include:

- **Semantic Structure:** Uses `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` for clear organization.
- **Navigation Bar:** Simple navigation links for Home, About, and Contact Us.
- **Main Content:**
  - An `<article>` with introductory text.
  - A `<section>` listing favorite hobbies using an unordered list.
  - An `<aside>` for quick links.
- **Footer:** Copyright information.

This file is a good example of how to structure a basic personal web page using semantic tags.

These pages were created to practice and demonstrate different HTML5 features, including semantic markup, navigation, lists, and media embedding. Each file is commented to help explain the purpose of the code sections.

Feel free to open each HTML file in your browser to see the results and review the code for learning purposes.
